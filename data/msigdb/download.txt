- Gene Ontology Biological Processes
    - Download gene sets from "C5: ontology gene sets -> GO: Gene Ontology gene sets -> BP: subset of GO" as a json file (c5.go.bp.v2023.1.Hs.json)
- HALLMARK
    - Download gene sets from "H: hallmark gene sets" as a json file (h.all.v2023.1.Hs.json)
- KEGG
    - Download gene sets from "C2: curated gene sets -> CP: Canonical pathways -> KEGG subset of CP" as a json file (c2.cp.kegg.v2023.1.Hs.json)
- Reactome
    - Download gene sets from "C2: curated gene sets -> CP: Canonical pathways -> Reactome subset of CP" as a json file (c2.cp.reactome.v2023.1.Hs.json)
